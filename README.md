# Open Insurance Brasil Certification

The Open Insurance Brasil Initial Structure enables deployments of Open Insurance Brasil Services and the Open Insurance Brasil Consent and Authorisation Process to be certificed to specific conformance profiles to promote interoperability among implementations. This process utilizes self-certification and conformance test suites developed by Raidiam Services Ltd at the request of the Open Insurance Brasil Initial Structure. This test suite and process leverages the tooling and processes published under MIT License by the Open ID Foundation to whom we give thanks for the significant effort and foundational contributions that have enabled this test suite to be developed.

Here's some places to learn more about the Open Insurance Brasil certification programme:

* The [certification source repository](https://gitlab.com/raidiam-conformance/open-insurance-brasil) contains links describing how to certify your deployments.

A CONDITIONAL PASS *may* be issued at the discretion of the testing working group where there is a potential ambiguity in the underlying specification. In such a situation and where a Insurer is returning an alternative response different from the majority of Open Insurance participants, the certification team may issue a CONDITIONAL PASS. A CONDITIONAL PASS will only be issued if the alternative interpretation has little or no impact to the operations of a Data Consumer or a TPP. A Insurer issued with a CONDITIONAL PASS must submit a recertification within 2 weeks demonstrating that the underlying response has been addressed.

A IN REVISION status *may* be issued where the testing working group has been informed of noncompliance with the specifications that may affect interoperability. Institutions issued with a IN REVISION status will have been notified and must rerun their tests in deadline to be established by the structure depending on the interoperbality issue.

A PASS\* status *may* be issued where the testing working group has been supplied with a technical submission that is conformant however the submitting institution has not provided accurate attestation of conformance documentation. This temporary state is only be available for 're-certification' submissions.

A PASS status will be issued when the testing working group receives a compliant technical submission and the requesting institution has provided accurate proof of compliance documentation. Certificates in “PASS” status *may* their status to “IN REVISION” when a previously unmapped technical issue is identified and it is considered highly critical to the ecosystem's interoperability environment
